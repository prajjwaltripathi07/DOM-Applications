A collection of small projects demonstrating the use of the Document Object Model (DOM) to create interactive web applications. This repository contains projects such as a digital clock, color changer, BMI calculator, guess the number game, and more. Each project showcases different DOM manipulation techniques using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
PROJECTS
1. Digital Clock
A simple digital clock application that displays the current time and updates every second. The time is displayed in hours, minutes, and seconds.

Features:
Real-time clock that updates every second.

3. BMI Calculator
A Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that takes a user's weight (in kg) and height (in meters), then calculates and displays the BMI value. The result also includes a message indicating the user's BMI category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese).

Features:
Input fields for weight and height.
Calculates and displays BMI along with a corresponding category.

4. Guess the Number Game
A simple game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The application provides feedback on whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct. The game ends when the correct number is guessed.
